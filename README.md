# Github Page Test

This is a test for Github page. I'm new in Github and want to explore everything in it, so I created this repository and use it as a webpage. You have access to [my page](https://tenggit.github.io/Github-Page-Test/).

At the same time, I'm learning HTML (at a very slow speed!), hoping to be better in the future.
